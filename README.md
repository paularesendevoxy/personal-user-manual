## About Me

* I’m Paula, I grew up in a small town in Minas Gerais called Ouro Branco (White Gold), named after the gold it had plenty, during colonial time. My hobbies are reading, and traveling (before the pandemic), and also I love sleeping. Which might imply that sometimes I do travel, but end up sleeping too much in the new place I was supposed to go sightseeing.

## How to Contact Me

* Feel free to contact me by slack or email: paula.resende@voxy.com. Also, let me know if you’d rather getting in touch through other plataforms.


## Preferred Working Style

* I feel more productive in the morning, so it is not a problem to start earlier, like 8am. 
* I also use Pomodoro Technique in all oportunities I have a chance, because it considerably helps me diminish my tiredness. 
* I love pair programming (however I also have to take 5 minutes to be psychologically prepared to do it beforehand, just like every meeting tbh).
* Every Tuesday I have a psychoanalysis session that makes my lunch break 12:20am to 2:20pm.
* I am more of introvert, but I am always open to socialize and do my best :)

## What Motivates Me

* Small tasks motivates me because I can see work done quicker.
* Also recognition and feedback (good or bad) makes me feel acquainted.

## What Demotivates Me

* Misaligned expectations that can be avoided with open communication. 

## My Values (and what I value in others)

* Cooperation and empathy are key values.
* I admire people who see value in spending time teaching and pairing with jr. software engineers.

## My Blind Spots
* Tests and APIs are still subjects I don’t have experience on.


## My Pet Peeves
* I don’t really have pet peeves. Well, sometimes I feel like I never know how to end conversations or even initiate them, but if I ever seem irritated to you, I’m more probably feeling socially awkward and that’s ok. 

## Other

* "How I like my 1:1s" - I am very open to feedbacks, and I sure want to know where I can get better, because it’s my goal everyday and no matter how good or bad it is I am willing to change to better fix my growth. 
* "What you can expect from me" - I love learning and listening. I’m quit but also looking forward to make new friends.
